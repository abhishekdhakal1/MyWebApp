      <p>
        I'm a second-semester student keen on learning web technologies,
        especially React.js and Next.js. My interests also include diving into
        machine learning and applying AI techniques to solve real-world
        problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I work on personal projects, continuously honing my
        coding skills and exploring new tools like Tailwind CSS.
